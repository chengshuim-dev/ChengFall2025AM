                    <h3>Distribution</h3>
                    <p>Aureoboletus mirabilis, which usually appears from late summer to autumn, is distributed in the hemlock forests of the Pacific Coast Ranges from Northern California to Alaska, the Cascade Range, as well as in interior forests such as in Manitoba. It has a disjunct distribution, as it has been also been collected in Japan and Taiwan.</p>
                </section>
               <section> <h2>Uses</h2>
            <p>Aureoboletus mirabilis is edible, yet tasteless according to Murrill, who also noted that <span id="highlight1">"this is one of the most difficult species to preserve, owing to its extremely juicy consistency".</span> In contrast, modern field guides suggest this species to be an excellent edible. One book opines that only Boletus edulis surpasses its flavour. When sauteed in butter, the flesh has been noted to have a lemony taste.</p>
            <p>Field specimens covered with the white mold Sepedonium ampullosporum should not be consumed.The mushroom may also be attacked by Hypomyces chrysospermus.</p>

     <h3>Habitat</h3>
     <p>
                       The fruit bodies grow solitarily, scattered, or sometimes in small groups on the ground or on well-decayed conifer logs, especially of western and mountain hemlock, but occasionally also Douglas-fir and western red cedar. The fungus is strongly suspected to form mycorrhizal associations with hemlock, although standard attempts at growing B. mirabilis mycorrhizae in laboratory culture have failed. Although fruit bodies are sometimes found growing on logs with advanced brown cubical rot—a trait suggestive of cellulose-decomposing saprobic fungi—the rotten wood harboring the fungi typically contains abundant conifer roots. It has been suggested that B. mirabilis has specifically adapted to this niche to reduce competition for nutrients with other mycorrhizal fungi, and further, that the inability to culture mycorrhizae in the lab using standard techniques may be because certain physical or chemical characteristics of the wood with brown cubical rot are required for fungal growth.
