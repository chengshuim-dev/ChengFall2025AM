    <ol><li> <h2>ABOUT</h2>
        <p id="BB">Suillus granulatus is a pored mushroom of the genus Suillus in the family Suillaceae. It has been commonly known as the weeping bolete,[3] or the granulated bolete. It is similar to the related S. luteus, but can be distinguished by its ringless stalk.

The species often grows in a symbiosis (mycorrhiza) with pine and is edible.</p>
            <p id="AA">The orange-brown, to brown-yellow cap is viscid (sticky) when wet, and shiny when dry, and is usually 4 to 12 cm in diameter.[10] The stem is pale yellow, of uniform thickness, with tiny brownish granules at the apex, and about 4–8 tall, 1–2 cm wide.[10] It is without a ring. The tubes and pores are small, pale yellow, and exude pale milky droplets when young. The flesh is also pale yellow.[10]</p>

            <li><h3>TAXONOMY</h3>
            <p id="BB">Suillus granulatus was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 as a species of Boletus.[4] It was given its current name by French naturalist Henri François Anne de Roussel when he transferred it to Suillus in 1796.[2] Suillus is an ancient term for fungi, and is derived from the word "swine". Granulatus means "grainy" and refers to the granular dots on the upper part of the stem.[5][6] However, in some specimens the granular dots may be inconspicuous and not darkening with age;[7] thus the name S. lactifluus, "oozing milk" was formerly applied to this form as it is not notably characterized by granular dots.[6]

            Previously thought to exist in eastern North America, that species has now been confirmed to be the rediscovered Suillus weaverae.[8][9]</p></li>
